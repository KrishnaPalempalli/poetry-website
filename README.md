# poetry-website

This is a poetry website that I created, when I was in high school between my 11th and 12 grade, using HTML, CSS, and jQuery for my final project for my Brown Pre-College summer class -  Creative Coding: Reading and Writing Web-based Literature. The poetry website has three pages that show various things about poetry in a funny and creative way. The pages uses creative visual elements, like videos, different fonts, images, links, etc., to create the interactive feature for web-based literature.
